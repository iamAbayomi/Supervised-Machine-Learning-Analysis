# Suoervised Machine Learning Analysis
This project involves conducting a supervised machine learning analysis. It includes setting up the project, installing necessary dependencies, and running tests. The analysis aims to achieve specific objectives using regression, classification, or other supervised learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn

```

### Installing


Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

```

Install Python 3 from the official website.
Install Jupyter Notebook using pip.
Install Scikit-learn library using pip.
```


## Running the tests

To run automated tests:

### End-to-End Tests

These tests assess the functionality of the entire system. Example:

```
Train a regression model and evaluate its performance.
Train a knn analysis model and evaluate its performance.
Train a Decision tree analysis and evaluate its performance.
```


## Deployment

Deploy the project using the following steps:

Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Launch Jupyter Notebook.
Load the project files and execute the analysis.
